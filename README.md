## ReadMe

This application processes donations from https://wfpb.fit using Stripe. 
Donations are securely passed from the client to Stripe where they are processed. 
This is done in [StripeRoute.js](https://github.com/WFPB-fit/wfpb.fit-backend/blob/master/src/StripeRoute.js)
All other files are here to get the Express.js application running and deployed on AWS Lambda.
